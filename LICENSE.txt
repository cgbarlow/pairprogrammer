EXPERT RESEARCH ATTRIBUTION:

This project incorporates philosophical frameworks and wisdom from the following software engineering thought leaders:

- Dave Farley: Co-author of "Continuous Delivery" and "Modern Software Engineering"
  Research and wisdom incorporated under fair use for educational and non-commercial purposes.

- Kent Beck: Creator of Extreme Programming, author of "Test-Driven Development" and "Tidy First?"
  Research and wisdom incorporated under fair use for educational and non-commercial purposes.

- Martin Fowler: Author of "Refactoring" and numerous influential software engineering works
  Research and wisdom incorporated under fair use for educational and non-commercial purposes.
