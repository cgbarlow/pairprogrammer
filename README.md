## Core Philosophy: Mixture of Agents (MOA) Architecture

The system employs a sophisticated **dual-mode Mixture of Agents approach** that synthesizes wisdom from 5 industry thought leaders based on context:

### 🧠 **Expert Agent Panel**

- **Dave Farley**: *"Software engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software."*
- **Kent Beck**: *"Software design is an exercise in human relationships."*
- **Martin Fowler**: *"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."*
