# Agentic Pair Programmer (PPMOA)

## Overview
An intelligent pair programming assistant that embodies the collective wisdom of software engineering thought leaders, providing real-time code review and planning assistance through automated triggers via Claude Code's MCP infrastructure.

## Core Philosophy
The agent synthesizes best practices from industry leaders, each bringing their unique perspective:

### Expert Wisdom Foundation
- **Dave Farley**: *"Software engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software."*
- **Kent Beck**: *"Software design is an exercise in human relationships."*
- **Martin Fowler**: *"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."*
- **Kevlin Henney**: *"There is no code faster than no code."* (Software as executable fiction)
- **Robert C. Martin**: *"It is not enough for code to work."* (Clean code craftsmanship)

## Technical Architecture

### Implementation Framework
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Integration**: Claude Code hooks for automated triggers
- **Configuration**: CLAUDE.md for behavior customization and .claude/hooks.yaml for trigger setup

### Core Functions

#### 1. Plan Review
- **Trigger**: Git issue creation/modification
- **Actions**:
  - Analyze issue description for clarity and completeness
  - Suggest acceptance criteria
  - Identify potential edge cases
  - Recommend implementation approach
  - Flag architectural concerns

#### 2. Code & Documentation Review
- **Trigger**: File write operations
- **Actions**:
  - Immediate feedback on code quality
  - Design pattern suggestions
  - Test coverage recommendations
  - Documentation completeness check
  - Performance and security considerations

## Behavioral Characteristics

### Communication Style
- Constructive and educational feedback
- Asks clarifying questions like a human pair programmer
- Provides context for suggestions
- Balances pragmatism with best practices

### Review Priorities
1. **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases
2. **Clarity**: Readability, naming, structure
3. **Maintainability**: SOLID principles, coupling
4. **Performance**: Only when relevant
5. **Security**: Input validation, common vulnerabilities

## Implementation Approaches

### Model Enhancement Strategies
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Fine-tune on code review datasets from the specified authors
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Index books, articles, and talks from thought leaders
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Curated examples of high-quality code reviews in CLAUDE.md
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Structured review templates that mirror expert thinking patterns
- **Semantic Code Embeddings**: Vector search for similar code patterns and their reviews

### Knowledge Integration Methods
- **Knowledge Graph**: Map relationships between design patterns, principles, and anti-patterns
- **AST Analysis**: Parse code structure for deeper pattern recognition
- **Static Analysis Integration**: Combine LLM insights with traditional code analysis tools
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different aspects (testing, architecture, security)
- **Contextual Memory**: Store project-specific patterns and team preferences

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Tool-Augmented Generation**: LLM orchestrates multiple code analysis tools
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn from accepted/rejected suggestions
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models specialized in different areas
- **Active Learning**: Request human feedback on uncertain recommendations
