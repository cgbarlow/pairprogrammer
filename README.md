## Core Philosophy: Mixture of Agents (MOA) Architecture

The system employs a sophisticated **dual-mode Mixture of Agents approach** that synthesizes wisdom from 5 industry thought leaders based on context:

### 🧠 **Expert Agent Panel**

- **Dave Farley**: *"Software engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software."*
- **Kent Beck**: *"Software design is an exercise in human relationships."*
- **Martin Fowler**: *"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."*
- **Kevlin Henney**: *"There is no code faster than no code."* (Software as executable fiction)
- **Robert C. Martin**: *"It is not enough for code to work."* (Clean code craftsmanship)

### 🎯 **Consensus Mode** (Code Operations)
**Triggers**: File writes, commits, code reviews  
**Operation**: 5 expert agents → internal coordination → unified response  
**Result**: Balanced, comprehensive feedback for development flow

### 🧠 **Singular Mode** (Planning Operations)  
**Triggers**: GitHub issues, PR discussions, architectural planning  
**Operation**: 5 expert agents → independent analysis → 5 distinct expert responses  
**Result**: Direct access to specific thought leader perspectives
