# Pair Programming Mixture of Agents (PPMOA): The ultimate pair programming partnership!

## Overview
An agentic pair programming partner that embodies the collective wisdom of software engineering thought leaders, providing real-time planning assistance and code review through automated triggers.

## Core Philosophy: Mixture of Agents (MOA) Architecture

The system employs a sophisticated **dual-mode Mixture of Agents approach** that synthesizes wisdom from industry leaders based on context:

### 🎯 **Consensus Mode** (Code Operations)
**Triggers**: File writes, commits, code reviews  
**Operation**: 5 expert agents → internal coordination → unified response  
**Result**: Balanced, comprehensive feedback for development flow

### 🧠 **Singular Mode** (Planning Operations)  
**Triggers**: GitHub issues, PR discussions, architectural planning  
**Operation**: 5 expert agents → independent analysis → 5 distinct expert responses  
**Result**: Direct access to specific thought leader perspectives

## Technical Architecture

### Implementation Framework
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Integration**: Claude Code hooks for automated triggers
- **Configuration**: CLAUDE.md for behavior customization and .claude/hooks.yaml for trigger setup

### Core Functions

#### 1. Planning Analysis (Singular Mode)
- **Triggers**: Git issue creation/modification, architectural discussions
- **MOA Operation**: 5 independent expert analyses
- **Expert Responses**:
  - **Dave Farley**: Continuous delivery and empirical validation perspective
  - **Kent Beck**: Human-centered design and incremental development approach  
  - **Martin Fowler**: Evolutionary design and refactoring patterns
  - **Kevlin Henney**: Simplicity-first and elegant design principles
  - **Uncle Bob**: Clean code standards and professional responsibility
- **Output**: 5 distinct messages providing specialized expert viewpoints

#### 2. Code Review (Consensus Mode)
- **Triggers**: File write operations, commits, pull requests
- **MOA Operation**: 5 expert agents → internal consensus → unified response
- **Consensus Areas**:
  - Code quality assessment with balanced expert perspectives
  - Design pattern recommendations synthesized from multiple viewpoints
  - Test coverage suggestions incorporating TDD and empirical approaches
  - Documentation completeness from communication-focused lens
  - Performance and security considerations across expert domains
- **Output**: Single comprehensive message representing collective wisdom

## Behavioral Characteristics

### Communication Style
- Constructive and educational feedback
- Asks clarifying questions like a human pair programmer
- Provides context for suggestions
- Balances pragmatism with best practices

### Review Priorities
1. **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases
2. **Clarity**: Readability, naming, structure
3. **Maintainability**: SOLID principles, coupling
4. **Performance**: Only when relevant
5. **Security**: Input validation, common vulnerabilities

## Implementation Approaches

### Model Enhancement Strategies
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Fine-tune on code review datasets from the specified authors
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Index books, articles, and talks from thought leaders
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Curated examples of high-quality code reviews in CLAUDE.md
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Structured review templates that mirror expert thinking patterns
- **Semantic Code Embeddings**: Vector search for similar code patterns and their reviews

### Knowledge Integration Methods
- **Knowledge Graph**: Map relationships between design patterns, principles, and anti-patterns
- **AST Analysis**: Parse code structure for deeper pattern recognition
- **Static Analysis Integration**: Combine LLM insights with traditional code analysis tools
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different aspects (testing, architecture, security)
- **Contextual Memory**: Store project-specific patterns and team preferences

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Tool-Augmented Generation**: LLM orchestrates multiple code analysis tools
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn from accepted/rejected suggestions
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models specialized in different areas
- **Active Learning**: Request human feedback on uncertain recommendations
