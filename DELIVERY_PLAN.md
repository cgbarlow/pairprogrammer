- Implementation-first approach (fix logic, not tests)
- Active monitoring after every push
- Auto-merge on CI success

### 3. SWARM DEPLOYMENT
- **Hierarchical topology** for features with 2+ sub-issues
- **Agent specialization** based on feature complexity
- **Memory coordination** through Claude Flow hooks
